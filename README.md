# RSS feed for the office infoscreen

The RSS feed is a temporary solution to display information on the dashboard on an infoscreen in the office. 

Link to integrate the feed: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/id-gue/dash-rss/master/dashboard.xml>
To be shown here: <https://dakboard.com/app>

The temporary solution to show a **calender** is a private iCloud account. Later we should be able to use Office365.
